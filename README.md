DroidCounter
============

Android project: simple time counter.  Practice UI design, event handling, system timer, etc.

Objective:
Develop a timer application that contains three buttons: start, pause/resume, reset; and one
text field. When the “start” button is clicked, the text field shows the elapsed time, in
seconds:milliseconds (e.g., 32:041). The timer pauses after “pause/resume” is clicked, and resumes if
“pause/resume” is clicked again. The timer stops and resets to 0:0 if “reset” is clicked.
